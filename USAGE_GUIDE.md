# Co-Apply Usage Guide

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/stewartDMS/Co-Apply.git
cd Co-Apply

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# (Optional) Install Playwright for autofill
playwright install chromium
```

### 2. First Time Setup

#### Initialize Your Profile

```bash
co-apply profile init
```

You'll be prompted for:
- Full Name
- Email
- Phone
- Location (optional)

#### Add Your Achievements

You can add achievements one by one:

```bash
co-apply achievement add
```

Or use the sample data to get started:

```bash
cp data/examples/sample_achievement.json data/user_achievements.json
```

### 3. Basic Workflow

#### Step 1: Parse a Job Description

Save the job description to a text file (e.g., `job.txt`), then:

```bash
co-apply job parse job.txt \
  --job-id "company-position-2024" \
  --title "Software Engineer" \
  --company "TechCorp"
```

This creates a structured JSON file in `data/jobs/`.

#### Step 2: Analyze Match Quality

```bash
co-apply analyze match company-position-2024
```

This shows:
- Relevance scores for each achievement
- Skills coverage percentage
- Recommendations

#### Step 3: Generate Tailored Documents

Generate a CV:
```bash
co-apply generate cv company-position-2024 -o my_cv.md
```

Generate a cover letter:
```bash
co-apply generate cover-letter company-position-2024 -o cover_letter.txt --tone professional
```

Cover letter tones:
- `professional` (default): Formal and balanced
- `enthusiastic`: More energetic and excited
- `formal`: Very formal and traditional

#### Step 4: Check ATS Compatibility

```bash
co-apply analyze ats my_cv.md company-position-2024
```

This provides:
- ATS match score (0-100%)
- Matched keywords
- Missing keywords
- Recommendations for improvement

#### Step 5: Track Your Application

```bash
# Add to tracker
co-apply track add company-position-2024 --status submitted

# List all applications
co-apply track list

# View statistics
co-apply track stats
```

Application statuses:
- `draft`: Working on application
- `submitted`: Application submitted
- `interviewing`: Interview scheduled/completed
- `offered`: Offer received
- `rejected`: Application rejected
- `accepted`: Offer accepted
- `withdrawn`: Application withdrawn

## Advanced Features

### Custom Achievements Format

Your `user_achievements.json` should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "email@example.com",
    "phone": "+1234567890",
    "location": "City, State",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile",
    "github": "https://github.com/yourusername",
    "website": "https://yoursite.com",
    "summary": "Brief professional summary"
  },
  "achievements": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id",
      "title": "Achievement Title",
      "description": "Detailed description of what you did",
      "category": "technical",
      "skills": ["Python", "AWS", "Docker"],
      "keywords": ["development", "cloud", "automation"],
      "impact": "What was the impact/outcome",
      "metrics": "Quantifiable metrics (e.g., '50% performance improvement')",
      "date": "2023-01 to 2023-06",
      "context": "Additional context (optional)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Categories:
- `technical`: Technical projects and implementations
- `leadership`: Leadership and management achievements
- `project`: Project delivery and management
- `certification`: Certifications and training

### Multiple CV Versions

Generate different versions programmatically:

```python
from co_apply.generators.cv_generator import CVGenerator
from co_apply.core.achievement_library import AchievementLibrary
from co_apply.core.job_parser import JobParser
from co_apply.analysis.matcher import AchievementJobMatcher

library = AchievementLibrary()
parser = JobParser()
job = parser.load_job("data/jobs/job-001.json")
matcher = AchievementJobMatcher()
matches = matcher.match_achievements_to_job(library.achievements, job)

generator = CVGenerator()
versions = generator.generate_multiple_versions(library.profile, matches, job)

# versions['concise'] - 1-page version
# versions['standard'] - Standard 2-page version
# versions['detailed'] - Detailed version with all achievements
```

### Diff Comparison

Compare two versions of your CV:

```python
from co_apply.analysis.diff_reviewer import DiffReviewer

reviewer = DiffReviewer()

with open('cv_v1.md', 'r') as f:
    original = f.read()
    
with open('cv_v2.md', 'r') as f:
    updated = f.read()

result = reviewer.compare(original, updated)

print(f"Similarity: {result.similarity_score}%")
print(f"Changes: {result.statistics['total_changes']}")

# Generate report
summary = reviewer.generate_change_summary(result)
print(summary)

# Save HTML diff for visual comparison
reviewer.save_html_diff(result, 'diff_report.html')
```

### Autofill (Advanced)

Use Playwright to automate form filling:

```python
from co_apply.autofill.form_filler import autofill_application

profile_data = {
    'first_name': 'Jane',
    'last_name': 'Doe',
    'email': 'jane@example.com',
    'phone': '555-1234',
    'linkedin': 'https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe',
    'github': 'https://github.com/janedoe'
}

file_uploads = {
    'resume': '/absolute/path/to/cv.pdf',
    'cover_letter': '/absolute/path/to/cover.pdf'
}

result = autofill_application(
    url='https://company.com/careers/apply/12345',
    profile_data=profile_data,
    file_uploads=file_uploads,
    headless=False  # Show browser for verification
)

if result['success']:
    print(f"Filled {result['fields_filled']} fields")
    print(f"Screenshot: {result['screenshot']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```

**Safety Notes:**
- Always review before submitting
- `auto_submit=False` by default
- Take screenshots for verification
- Test on dummy applications first

## Tips & Best Practices

### Writing Good Achievements

1. **Use the STAR method**: Situation, Task, Action, Result
2. **Include metrics**: Quantify impact whenever possible
3. **Be specific**: Use concrete examples
4. **Include skills**: List all relevant technical skills used
5. **Add keywords**: Include industry-standard terms

Example:
```
Title: "Optimized Database Performance"
Description: "Identified performance bottlenecks in PostgreSQL database supporting 1M+ users. Redesigned indexes, optimized queries, and implemented connection pooling."
Impact: "Reduced API response time by 60% and database CPU usage by 40%"
Metrics: "Improved average query time from 800ms to 320ms"
Skills: ["PostgreSQL", "SQL", "Performance Optimization", "Database Design"]
Keywords: ["database", "optimization", "performance", "sql", "postgresql"]
```

### Maximizing ATS Score

1. **Use standard section headers**: "Experience", "Education", "Skills"
2. **Include exact keywords**: Copy key terms from job description
3. **Avoid fancy formatting**: Keep it simple and readable
4. **Use standard fonts**: Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman
5. **Save as .txt or .docx**: For best ATS compatibility
6. **Repeat important keywords**: Naturally throughout the document

### Managing Multiple Applications

Use descriptive job IDs:
```bash
# Good
co-apply job parse job.txt --job-id "google-swe-backend-2024"
co-apply job parse job.txt --job-id "amazon-sde2-seattle-2024"

# Less helpful
co-apply job parse job.txt --job-id "job1"
co-apply job parse job.txt --job-id "job2"
```

### Iterative Improvement

1. Generate initial version
2. Check ATS score
3. Add missing keywords
4. Compare versions using diff
5. Repeat until satisfied

```bash
# Initial generation
co-apply generate cv job-001 -o cv_v1.md
co-apply analyze ats cv_v1.md job-001

# After manual improvements
co-apply analyze ats cv_v2.md job-001

# Compare
python -c "
from co_apply.analysis.diff_reviewer import DiffReviewer
reviewer = DiffReviewer()
with open('cv_v1.md') as f1, open('cv_v2.md') as f2:
    result = reviewer.compare(f1.read(), f2.read())
    print(reviewer.generate_change_summary(result))
"
```

## Troubleshooting

### "No relevant achievements found"

The matching threshold (default 0.3) might be too high. Lower it programmatically:

```python
from co_apply.analysis.matcher import AchievementJobMatcher

matcher = AchievementJobMatcher()
matches = matcher.match_achievements_to_job(achievements, job)
relevant = matcher.filter_by_threshold(matches, threshold=0.2)
```

### ATS Score Too Low

1. Add more keywords from job description to your achievements
2. Ensure skills match exactly (case-insensitive)
3. Include company-specific terms and technologies
4. Use industry-standard terminology

### Playwright Issues

```bash
# Reinstall Playwright browsers
playwright install --force chromium

# Check browser installation
playwright install --help
```

## Examples

See the `data/examples/` directory for:
- `sample_achievement.json`: Example achievement library
- `sample_job_description.txt`: Example job description
